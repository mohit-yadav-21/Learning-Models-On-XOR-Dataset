# Learning-Models-On-XOR-Dataset

Theis file is a part of the submission for a course assignment I did as a part of the course ES335: Machine Learning, taught in the Fall semester of session 2024-25. The question:

Learn the following models on XOR dataset (refer to Tensorflow Playground and generate the dataset on your own containing 200 training instances and 200 test instances) such that all these models achieve similar results (good). The definition of good is left subjective â€“ but you would expect the classifier to capture the shape of the XOR function. 
- a MLP

- MLP w/ L1 regularization (you may vary the penalty coefficient by choose the best one using a validation dataset)

- MLP w/ L2 regularization (you may vary the penalty coefficient by choose the best one using a validation dataset)

- learn logistic regression models on the same data with additional features (such as x1*x2, x1^2, etc.)

Show the decision surface and comment on the plots obtained for different models. [2 marks]
